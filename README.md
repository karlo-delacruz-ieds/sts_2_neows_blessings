# Neow's Blessings Ascension 20 Top Picks | Analyzing Slay the Spire Data

For this project, I’ll share with you my findings on choosing Neow’s Blessings at the start of the Slay the Spire game. I'll use the Ascension 20 winning runs data to plot the frequency of selected blessings by most players. The resulting charts will help most players have a general strategy for picking the right Neow’s Blessings for their case.
